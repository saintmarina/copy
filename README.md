## What is POSIX?

POSIX-compliant software adheres to the standards outlined in the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) standard, which defines a set of APIs and conventions for Unix-like operating systems. Writing POSIX-compliant programs ensures portability across different Unix-like systems, enabling software to run consistently across various platforms. This is important for compatibility, interoperability, and reducing the need for extensive modifications when transitioning between different operating environments.

OSs that can run POSIX complian program without much editing:
- macOS
- FreeBSD
- OpenBSD
- Solaris
- AIX
